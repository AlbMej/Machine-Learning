# Image Classification

In this project, I have designed three classifiers: a naive Bayes classifier, a perceptron classifier and a large-margin (MIRA) classifier. These classifiers are tested on two image data sets: a set of scanned handwritten digit images and a set of face images in which edges have already been detected. Even with simple features, the classifiers do quite well on these tasks when given enough training data.

The first data set is a collection of handwritten numerical digits (0-9).

This project implements solves a simplified face detection task in which our system is presented with an image that has been pre-processed by an edge detection algorithm. The task is to determine whether the edge image is a face or not.

TODOs:
- Finish Jupyter Notebook write up.
